# Mass-UUID-Generator-Tool
updated from my old uuid generator
run node uuid.js and then input a number example: 22, it will then generate 22 UUIDs and save them to the txt file, it will also print them in the terminal for quick use but that isnt the main purpose i have a tool on my page that does 2 at a time, for people who have a genuine purpose for UUIDs, no they have no bad purpose its just you dont need such a tool for a task as easy as that
i have realised colorama is not in this script which is a shame, i wont be adding it but in the case you want to you can.. i see no purpose for this script looking back at it but its fine
