# Mass-UUID-Generator-Tool
updated from my old uuid generator
run node uuid.js and then input a number example: 22, it will then generate 22 UUIDs and save them to the txt file, it will also print them in the terminal for quick use but that isnt the main purpose i have a tool on my page that does 2 at a time, for people who have a genuine purpose for UUIDs, no they have no bad purpose its just you dont need such a tool for a task as easy as that
